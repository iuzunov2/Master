            <p>Squid Game received critical acclaim and attracted international attention. Within a week of its release, it became one of Netflix's most-watched programs in several regional markets, and within its first 28 days of availability, drew more than 111 million viewers, surpassing Bridgerton as the network's most-watched show.</p>
